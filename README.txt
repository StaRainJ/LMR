## LMR: Learning A Two-class Classifier for Mismatch Removal

## Usage:

 Prerequisites: matlab (test on 2015b and 2016b), vlfeat
 
 There are several trained classifiers in "Trained_Model" generated by the authors using the "trainingData".
 1.  Run the LMR_Test.m for mismatch removal using trained classifiers, three models you can choose including:1)Neural Network (Net.mat);  2)Random Forest (RF.mat)  3)SVM (svmStructure.mat)
 2.  Run the LMR_Train.m if you want to train the cllasifier by yourself.
 
Note: if any error exists in vlfeat, please redownload it from its homepage www.vlfeat.org/  ,  then uncompress and rename it.
